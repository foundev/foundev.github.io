<p>Last week I did a talk on Windsor and it went..ok. I’m not used to online presentations and am more experienced in front of crowds that I can interact with.</p>
<p>So between last week’s experience and some advice from <a href="https://lostechies.com/blogs/joe_ocampo/" target="_blank">Agile Joe</a> this talk I’ll be aiming for more of a screen cast feel.&#160; The talk should go for close to an hour and will be open for questions afterword.</p>
<p>Outline is as follows (subject to change):</p>
<ul>
<li>Monorail</li>
<li>Controllers</li>
<li>Windsor integration</li>
<li>Grouping controllers (“Area’s”)</li>
<li>
<p>Aspect Oriented Programming through Filters</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brail View Engine</p>
</li>
<li>Conditionals and Iterators</li>
<li>Parent/Child Views</li>
<li>Sub Views</li>
<li>
<p>Rescues</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Active Record</p>

<li>Architecture overview</li>
<li>Using multiple databases</li>
<li>Using Active Record in a more DDD friendly way</li>
