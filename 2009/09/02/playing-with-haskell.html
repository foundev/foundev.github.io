<p>My tech book club is starting to look at Haskell. I&#8217;m as big of a language addict as anyone so I wanted to dive in early and this is the overview of what I&#8217;ve found so far</p>
<h3>Statically Typed But Dynamically Inferred</h3>
<p>for those of you familiar with Boo this is a familiar concept to you. Once a type is made that type will not autoconvert. For Example:</p>
<p>let i = 6 &#8211;this is now going to be an integer </p>
<p>let f = 1.2 &#8211;this is now a float </p>
<p>i + f /&#8211;will throw exception </p>
<h3>Cannot set variable twice</h3>
<p>this is from what I understand something that all functional languages share some concept of. (Erlang views the second attempt to set a variable as a &#8220;match&#8221; request).</p>
<p>x = 10</p>
<p>x = 11</p>
<p>when running the source file results in: </p>
<p>Multiple declarations of `Main.x&#8217; </p>
<p>Declared at: functions.hs:1:0</p>
<p>functions.hs:2:0 </p>
<p>Failed, modules loaded: none. </p>
<h3>My Least Favorite Thing In Python AKA Significant Whitespace</h3>
<p>In the above code file in my previous example I had an error with an extra whitespace hiding about. I got used to this in Python by using soft tabs and being aware of phantom white space. Not happy about this. </p>
<h3>No Loops!</h3>
<p>The two primary ways I&#8217;ve found to replace loops are recursion and map. Map is a standard of functional languages and pretty easy to grasp. It&#8217;s just a way of saying &#8220;run a specified function on each item in the list&#8221;. A quick example of map is as follows:</p>
<p>doubleList ls = map doubleInt ls &#8212; function named &#8220;doublelist&#8221; with parameter of ls<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where doubleInt x = x*2&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211;doubles x which represents each value in list</p>
<p>doubled = doubleList [1,2,3,4,5] &#8211;set global variable with function applied</p>
<h3>At A Glance</h3>
<p>Haskell seems to have an easier to learn syntax than Erlang, while still being less ceremonial than other languages I&#8217;ve used. I kinda dig the no parenthesis syntax of functions, and of course I don&#8217;t miss foreach loops with map.</p>
<p>Finally, I&#8217;ll be anxious to find out what the multi-core story is vs Erlang.</p>
