<p><em>EDIT: this is an old post copied over from my <a href="https://lostechies.com/ryansvihla/2009/05/28/ironpython-how-cool-it-is/">old blog on Los Techies</a>, I have kept it here for archival reasons.</em></p>
<p>Briefly, <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/IronPython">IronPython</a> is an implementation of Python in the .Net runtime. This allows you access to .Net framework goodness while programming in a dynamic language. The current stable version 2.0.1 maps to CPython 2.5.This allows me to do fun fun things like use my python project to access a c# project. follows is a python script using Pinsor and accessing a .net dll.</p>
<p>C# code:</p>
<p>```csharp</p>
<p>public class Command
{</p>
<pre><code>private readonly DoingStuff _stuff;

public Command (DoingStuff stuff)
{
     _stuff = stuff;
    }

public void Execute()
{
    Console.WriteLine(_stuff.Message);
    }
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>public class DoingStuff
{
        public string Message
        {
        get { return "From the Doing Stuff Class, I'm doing stuff"; }
    }
}
```</p>
<p>python code:</p>
<p>```python
from pinsor import *
import clr
clr.AddReference('csharpdemo')
from csharpdemo import *</p>
<p>kernel = PinsorContainer()
kernel.register( Component.oftype(DoingStuff),Component.oftype(Command).depends([DoingStuff])  )</p>
<p>cmd = kernel.resolve(Command)
cmd.Execute()
```</p>
<p>ouput is like:</p>
<p><code>shell
C:\ipyexmaple&gt;c:\Program Files\IronPython 2.0.1\ipy.exe ipydemo.py
From the Doing Stuff Class, I'm doing stuff</code></p>
<p>I'm sure this causes a "what the heck" so let me summarize:</p>
<ol>
<li>created c# dll</li>
<li>placed a python script next to it named ipydemo.py</li>
<li>in that script I imported the c# dll</li>
<li>then I called my custom python IoC container Pinsor which is written in pure python</li>
<li>added .Net objects to my python IoC container</li>
<li>resolved a .Net object from my python IoC container</li>
<li>then executed it with the expected results and dependencies.</li>
</ol>
<p>When I did this test I stared at the screen completely stunned for a bit.Pinsor was very easy to implement, and it has some decent abilities considering its short life and my limited time.</p>
<p>I doubt I could make the same thing in C# in twice as much time, and I'm more experienced in C#.
This opens up some worlds for me.</p>
<p>With all this in mind has anyone had a chance to play with ironpython support in VS 2010?</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to thank [Micheal Foord](http://www.voidspace.org.uk/cv.shtml with his blog and book <a href="http://www.manning.com/foord/">IronPython In Action</a>. I highly recommend reading both if you are interested in quality programming, but especially if any of this intrigues you.</p>
