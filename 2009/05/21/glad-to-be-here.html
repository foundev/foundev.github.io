<p>Hi, my name is Ryan Svihla, and I’m the newest member of Los Techies; and I’d like to provide some background for most of you wondering, “who is this guy.”</p>
<p>I’ve recently moved to San Antonio, TX, and love it here. I don’t miss the winters and humidity of the farm states where I previously lived. I greatly appreciate the local developer community and learning at the feet of people like Jasdeep, <a href="https://lostechies.com/blogs/jason_meridth/default.aspx">Jason</a>, <a href="https://lostechies.com/blogs/joe_ocampo/default.aspx">Joe</a>, Josh](https://lostechies.com/blogs/joshua_lockwood/default.aspx), <a href="http://devlicio.us/blogs/anne_epstein/default.aspx">Anne</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/pjdennis">Phil</a>, and many others.</p>
<p>I work for a local bank for my day job, where I am a developer-focused in C# My duties center on maintaining a legacy backend and acting as an architect to our intranet and job server. My previous experience was primarily in consulting as a Windows and *NIX sysadmin, which gave me a pragmatic bent, so I don’t tend to get too wrapped up in platforms, languages, or brands.</p>
<p>I attend <a href="http://www.alamocoders.net/">Alamocoders</a>, <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/saruby?lnk=srg&amp;hl=en">SA ruby</a>, <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/virtualaltnet?lnk=srg&amp;hl=en">Virtual Alt.Net</a>, and <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/san-antonio-tech-book-club?lnk=srg&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8">SA tech book club</a> meetings regularly and have created a couple of very humble projects in <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pinsor/">Pinsor</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/specmaker/">SpecMaker</a> (the latter is still in pre-release status).</p>
<p>You can follow me on <a href="http://twitter.com/rssvihla">Twitter</a> or contact me at rssvihla at Gmail dot com if you have any questions or want to chat. Finally, I want to thank Jason again for inviting me here; I’ll work hard. I live up to the high standards set by others.</p>
