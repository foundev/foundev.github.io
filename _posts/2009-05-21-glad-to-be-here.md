<h1>Glad to be here</h1>

*EDIT: this is an old post copied over from my [old blog on Los Techies](https://lostechies.com/ryansvihla/2009/05/21/glad-to-be-here/), I have kept it here for archival reasons. The contact info and links below are almost certainly no longer accurate*

Hi, my name is Ryan Svihla, and I’m the newest member of Los Techies; and I’d like to provide some background for most of you wondering, “who is this guy.”

I’ve recently moved to San Antonio, TX, and love it here. I don’t miss the winters and humidity of the farm states where I previously lived. I greatly appreciate the local developer community and learning at the feet of people like Jasdeep, [Jason](https://lostechies.com/blogs/jason_meridth/default.aspx), [Joe](https://lostechies.com/blogs/joe_ocampo/default.aspx), Josh](https://lostechies.com/blogs/joshua_lockwood/default.aspx), [Anne](http://devlicio.us/blogs/anne_epstein/default.aspx), [Phil](http://twitter.com/pjdennis), and many others.

I work for a local bank for my day job, where I am a developer-focused in C# My duties center on maintaining a legacy backend and acting as an architect to our intranet and job server. My previous experience was primarily in consulting as a Windows and *NIX sysadmin, which gave me a pragmatic bent, so I don’t tend to get too wrapped up in platforms, languages, or brands.

I attend [Alamocoders](http://www.alamocoders.net/), [SA ruby](http://groups.google.com/group/saruby?lnk=srg&hl=en), [Virtual Alt.Net](http://groups.google.com/group/virtualaltnet?lnk=srg&hl=en), and [SA tech book club](http://groups.google.com/group/san-antonio-tech-book-club?lnk=srg&hl=en&ie=UTF-8) meetings regularly and have created a couple of very humble projects in [Pinsor](http://code.google.com/p/pinsor/) and [SpecMaker](http://code.google.com/p/specmaker/) (the latter is still in pre-release status).

You can follow me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/rssvihla) or contact me at rssvihla at Gmail dot com if you have any questions or want to chat. Finally, I want to thank Jason again for inviting me here; I’ll work hard. I live up to the high standards set by others.
