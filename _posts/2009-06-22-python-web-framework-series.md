<h1>Python Web Framework Series</h1>
I've wanted to dive more in depth into Python's web frameworks for some time and get to know them the way I know Castle Monorail.

What better way to learn something in depth than to have to know it well enough to show to someone else.Therefore, I plan on posting a relatively in depth walkthrough of Pylons (and if the interest is there Django and Turbogears as well). 

My source material is various articles on the web and [The Definitive Guide to Pylons by James Gardner](https://thejimmyg.github.io/pylonsbook/) which I suggest reading for those interested into diving deeper into pylons.

### Index

#### Pylons (will be updating links and subjects as I advance)
