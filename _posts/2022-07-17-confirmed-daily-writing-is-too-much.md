# Confirmed Daily Writing is Too Much

Not much to say here, but my little experiment lasted a week (and even then I missed a day).

While I admit this is starting to pull opinions out of the back of my head and that is useful and I do see the appeal for others, but I think meditation can give me that.

I think a good middle ground maybe every weekend. I believe I have some good or at least interesting ideas to document for myself and sometimes link to others, but I was really reaching for ideas by day 5.
