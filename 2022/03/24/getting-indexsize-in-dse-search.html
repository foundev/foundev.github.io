<p>Applies to DSE Search versions 3.2 to 6.8 </p>
<p>For some reason finding this information is dreadfully stupidly hard and I finally decided to write it down myself since I own it and someone may benefit from it some day.
There are three ways that I know of (I am sure there is a JMX way I just do not happen to know it atm)</p>
<ol>
<li>via curl (and using jq but grep will suffice)  <code>curl "http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/cores?action=STATUS&amp;wt=json&amp;indent=true"  | jq '.status."mykeyspace.mytable".index.size'</code></li>
<li>via ls and awk (assuming no du is available as is the case in the dse docker image) <code>ls -A -R -g -o "$@" /var/lib/cassandra/data/solr.data/mykeyspace.mytable/index | awk '{n1 += $3} END {print n1}' | awk '{ byte =$1 /1024/1024; print byte " MB" }'</code> </li>
<li>via the solradmin and just eyeballing the per segment sizes http://localhost:8983/solr/#/mykeyspace.mytable/segments</li>
</ol>
<p>I have had a deep dive to find this so many times I wish I had just posted this years ago</p>
