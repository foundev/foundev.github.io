title: Configuring UFW with Mosh support 
tags: [mosh, ufw]

<p><a href="https://blink.sh/">Mosh</a> is kind of my secret weapon for working remotely but getting it configured to be allowed through the firewall is something I always seem to forget. So here is my
UFW script I use for new servers with mosh added in:</p>
<p>```
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp</p>
<h1>this is hte part that allows mosh to work</h1>
<p>sudo ufw allow 60000:61000/udp
sudo ufw enable
```</p>
