<h3><font color="#ff0000">NOTE: this applies to Hudson version 1.352</font></h3>
<p>Ok so yesterday I was setting up a publicly accessible build server, that was not to be viewable to anonymous sources. So I configured Hudson to “matrix security” and disallowed all access to anonymous see fig 1-1.However, once I did this my slaves stopped working entirely.&#160; Now I could have allowed some anonymous access but here was the long sought for trick.</p>
<p>1) configure slaves to use “launch method” JNLP fig 1-2 below.</p>
<p>2) on client use java webstart to install the service by going to “http://yourserver:port/computer/slave-name/slave-agent.jnlp”. Make sure you select "install as a windows service”. In my case I had to select “file” then “install as a windows service”</p>
<p>3) open up wherever your base Hudson slave home was (mine was c:hudson) and find&#160; hudson-slave.xml.</p>
<p>4) once hudson-slave.xml is open look for the arguments line and make the following changes (replace user:pass with whatever your username and password is that has rights).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>before: <arguments>-Xrs -jar "%BASE%slave.jar" -jnlpUrl <http://yourserver:8080/computer/yourslave/slave-agent.jnlp\</arguments>></p>
<p>after:&#160;&#160;&#160; <arguments>-Xrs -jar "%BASE%slave.jar" -jnlpUrl <a href="http://yourserver:8080/computer/yourslave/slave-agent.jnlp">http://yourserver:8080/computer/yourslave/slave-agent.jnlp</a> -jnlpCredentials user:pass -auth user:pass</arguments></p>
</blockquote>
<p>5) restart your hudson slave service and after a page refresh on your build server you should now have an up and reporting node!</p>
